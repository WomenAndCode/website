            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <h2>It is important to inspire women to excel in technology</h2>
            <p>Diversity is very important for healthy networks, work relationships and our society in general.
                As positive role models we want to inspire other women to join the field of software engineering.
            </p>
            <h2>We want to have an impact on our city</h2>
            <p>A new non-profit feminist network and meetup/event-series brings more women into tech and encourages
                women to help other women.

            </p>
            <p>We want to empower women through solidarity, ideas, impulses, network, support, coaching, and
                sharing knowledge, time and space.
            </p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h2>Why should I join?</h2>
            <p>It is a great opportunity for you if you are working in marketing, design, or a business collaborating
                with
                developers, or if you are thinking about a career change in order to become independent and make more
                money.
                Tech is especially perfect for (single) mums!
            </p>
            <h2>How is teaching women differnt to teaching men or mixed classes?</h2>
            <p>Teaching a women-only class is in many aspects different to teaching mixed classes, especially when
                teaching
                programming. On the one hand you could have gender bias from a male instructor and on the other hand
                having
                even just one male student in class changes the whole group dynamic in the classroom. Some women
                suddenly don't
                dare to ask questions. With Women And Code we want to offer an open, inclusive, and non-threatening
                environment
                for women to learn.
            </p>
            <h2>How do you define 'women'?</h2>
            <p>The term 'woman' includes people of all colors, shapes, and ages, including but not limited to cis fem,
                bi, trans, girlies and grannies, tomboys and the like.
            </p>
